### üíª Tech Stack

[Tech stack badges remain the same as in the original README]

### üöÄ Projects

#### QuantumChowCrypt-Sim
A quantum computing simulator for encryption using an improved Chow algorithm. This project explores the intersection of quantum computing and cryptography.

**Technologies:** Python, Qiskit, NumPy

#### ML_DSS_Drowsiness_Detection
A Machine Learning project that implements a real-time facial recognition system to detect signs of drowsiness in drivers. It uses computer vision techniques and convolutional neural networks to analyze facial patterns, eye movement, and blink frequency.

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras

#### SignWave
Similar to the drowsiness detection project, this application focuses on gesture translation. It utilizes machine learning and computer vision to interpret sign language.

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV

#### nickhernm-web
A personal blog that also serves as a forum. This project showcases web development skills and community engagement.

**Technologies:** React, Node.js, MongoDB

#### QuantumDESolver
A hybrid programming approach to solve differential equation systems using quantum computing techniques. This project aims to improve temporal complexity in solving complex mathematical problems.

**Technologies:** Python, Qiskit, TensorFlow

#### Sistema de Control Ambiental Inteligente
An intelligent environmental control system that uses Arduino sensors to measure parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality. A Raspberry Pi acts as the brain, managing data and controlling fans or heating/cooling systems based on measurements.

**Technologies:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Python, Grafana (for real-time graphics and historical data visualization)
